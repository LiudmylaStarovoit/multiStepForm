In this project, I implemented the following functionality:
- Users can complete each step of a multi-step sequence.
- Users can navigate back to previous steps to update their selections.
- A summary of selections is displayed on the final step, allowing users to confirm their order.
- The interface layout adapts to the user's device screen size for optimal viewing.
- All interactive elements have hover and focus states.
- Form validation is implemented to show messages when:
- a field is left empty.
- a step is submitted without any selection.
